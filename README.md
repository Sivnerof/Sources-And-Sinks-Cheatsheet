# Sources and Sinks Cheatsheet

## Summary

This file contains common JavaScript sources and sinks that lead to potential vulnerabilities. All examples were taken from [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/ "PortSwigger Website") lessons on [Dom-Based vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based "Dom Based Vulnerabilities Lesson On PortSwigger").

## What Are Sources and Sinks?

PortSwigger Definition For Sources:

> A source is a JavaScript property that accepts data that is potentially attacker-controlled. An example of a source is the location.search property because it reads input from the query string, which is relatively simple for an attacker to control. Ultimately, any property that can be controlled by the attacker is a potential source. This includes the referring URL (exposed by the document.referrer string), the user's cookies (exposed by the document.cookie string), and web messages.

PortSwigger Definition For Sinks:

> A sink is a potentially dangerous JavaScript function or DOM object that can cause undesirable effects if attacker-controlled data is passed to it. For example, the eval() function is a sink because it processes the argument that is passed to it as JavaScript. An example of an HTML sink is document.body.innerHTML because it potentially allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and execute arbitrary JavaScript.

* has()

* constructor()

* init()

* index()

* jQuery.parseHTML()

* $.parseHTML()
